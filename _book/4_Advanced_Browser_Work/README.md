## Advanced Browser Work

### Description
There's a whole lot more to using Javascript in the browser than just manipulating simple DOM elements with jQuery.  If you want to grab data from external sites or your own back end, submit forms, or handle more complicated games, you'll need to dig deeper into how Javascript handles things like callbacks.  Here we'll also cover how to build games using HTML5's `<canvas>` element, which lets you use Javascript logic to draw shapes.  

1. Loading Javascript in the Browser
    /js_to_browser.md
    A very quick look at how and when to load Javascript.
2. Callbacks: Living in an Event-Driven World
    /event_driven.md
    This will connect what you know about events with a standard pattern for hooking into those events -- the callback.
4. PROJECT: Callbacks
    /project_callbacks.md
    A chance to apply what you've learned about callbacks by building another in-browser app.
5. Using Canvas to Draw and More
    /canvas.md
    Once you can use canvas, you're only limited by your creativity (and maybe your geometry skills).
6. PROJECT: Building Games with Canvas
    /project_canvas.md
    You'll see how much fun it can be to build with canvas as we bring back the classics with Missile Command!
