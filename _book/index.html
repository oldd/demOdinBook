                                <h1 id="how-this-course-will-work">How This Course Will Work</h1>
<p>Javascript is the future of the web.  More and more of the logic is making its way to the client side in order to facilitate lightning fast user experiences.  Javascript is even moving to the server side with Node.js.  That&apos;s why in this course we&apos;ll be diving deep into it to make sure you come out with a good understanding of how it works.</p>
<p>You&apos;ve already completed the <a href="web-development-101#section-the-front-end">Web Development 101 course</a>, right?  Good, because now we&apos;ll be moving at warp speed into new frontiers.  This section will cover a lot of ground and your brain may melt down a few times, but don&apos;t worry, that&apos;s just a flesh wound.  Patch &apos;er up and keep going!  When in doubt, build something.</p>
<h2 id="the-path">The Path</h2>
<p>So how is this course set up? It starts with a deeper look at the basics, just like the <a href="ruby-programming">Ruby Programming course</a> did with Ruby.  You don&apos;t need to have completed the Ruby Programming course or <a href="ruby-on-rails">the Ruby on Rails course</a> to understand these basics but we won&apos;t be focusing deeply on the really basic coding items so it&apos;ll move quickly.  You should, however, already have completed the <a href="web-development-101">Web Development 101 course</a>, specifically the <a href="web-development-101#section-the-front-end">Front End Section</a> before starting this course.  </p>
<p>After we&apos;ve finished going over the basics of Javascript and jQuery, we&apos;ll dive deeper into the actual language of Javascript so you can go beyond just playing around with your browser elements.  Again, we won&apos;t assume you&apos;ve completed the Ruby course here but we will be drawing some comparisons to Ruby for those who have in order to illustrate the differences between the two languages.</p>
<p>We&apos;ll port that newfound knowledge into working with some more complicated games in the browser using the new HTML5 Canvas element.  If you were playing games in the late 80&apos;s and 90&apos;s, you may get deja vu.</p>
<p>The sections following that <em>will</em> require you to have completed the Ruby on Rails course, because you&apos;ll be integrating the front ends of your applications (built with HTML, CSS and Javascript) with the back end of your applications built on Rails.  This is the part where it all comes together and you&apos;ll find yourself looking at real full stack web applications.  If you&apos;re allergic to Rails, you can substitute these back ends for a third-party Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) providers like <a href="http://firebase.com" target="_blank">Firebase</a> or <a href="http://apigee.com" target="_blank">Apigee</a>, though we won&apos;t cover specifically how to do that. </p>
<p>We&apos;ll wrap up by diving into using Javascript (instead of Ruby) to run your server with Node.js and how to port most of your application logic to the front end by using front-end frameworks like Backbone.js, Angular.js and Ember.js.  </p>
<p>The last thing you&apos;ll do is a final project which integrates everything you&apos;ve learned in all the courses of this curriculum.  This is the kind of project that you&apos;ll be telling employers all about and a great chance to prove that you&apos;re now, officially, a serious web developer.  </p>
<h3 id="this-is-a-work-in-progress">This is a Work in Progress!</h3>
<p>Again, note that this course is a work in progress.  Because of this, don&apos;t be alarmed if there are a few things marked TODO.  If you do find a resource that is particularly helpful or unhelpful, please let us know! </p>
<h2 id="format">Format</h2>
<p>There&apos;s a lot to cover but it&apos;s been broken up into bite-sized lessons and their accompanying projects.  The projects will give you a chance to apply what you&apos;ve learned and to show what you&apos;re capable of.  After a few of them, you&apos;ll really start getting the hang of things.  </p>
<h3 id="in-each-lesson">In each lesson:</h3>
<ol>
<li>We&apos;ll introduce the topic briefly and provide you with a list of things you should pay attention to (&quot;Points to Ponder&quot;).</li>
<li>You&apos;ll be asked to do readings, watch videos, do online courses or otherwise consume content to initially learn the material.</li>
<li>Every few lessons you will be asked to build a larger project.</li>
<li>Finally, we&apos;ll include additional helpful resources and other potentially useful tidbits at the end of each lesson.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="enough-talk-get-learning">Enough talk, get learning!</h2>
