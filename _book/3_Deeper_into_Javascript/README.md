## Deeper into Javascript

### Description
You can do a lot with just basic Javascript, jQuery and a hacker mindset.  But this section will take you deeper into how Javascript is actually doing things and it will give you the tools to produce more advanced functionality for your sites.  Some of the previous projects have probably tested the boundaries of your understanding of Javascript, and here we'll fix that.

1. Objects, 'Classes', and Prototypes
    /objects_prototypes.md
    Learn how to effectively use Javascript objects and DRY up your code with Prototypes.
2. Scope and Closures
    /scope_closures.md
    Scope gets a bit tricky in Javascript because functions are being passed around and called in many different contexts.
3. PROJECT: Tic Tac Toe
    /project_scopes_closures.md
    Let's bring the classic Tic Tac Toe game to the browser.
4. Comparing Javascript and Ruby: Going Functional
    /comparing_to_ruby.md
    A brief primer for translating your Ruby knowledge into Javascript 
5. Really Understanding Functions in Javascript
    /deep_dive_functions.md
    Functions are first class citizens in Javascript, and here you'll see why.
6. PROJECT: Minesweeper
    /project_functions.md
    It's time to get a bit more complex by bringing back minesweeper, the only decent game that used to come with Windows back in the day.
