## Better Forms with jQuery and AJAX

### Description
In this section you'll learn about AJAX, the technology which allows you to send data from the browser to your web application without needing to refresh the page.  It's commonly used with forms, but really represents a whole world of possibility for crafting performant user experiences.

1. Validating Form Inputs Using jQuery
    /jquery_forms.md
    You're an expert in forms by now, but here we'll focus on using jQuery to hook into them.
2. PROJECT: Validating a Form with jQuery
    /project_forms.md
    A chance to use jQuery's Validate plugin and then roll your own form validation.
3. Submitting a Form Without Reloading by Using AJAX
    /ajax.md
    AJAX is the missing link between a seamless client-side experience and your server-side code.
4. PROJECT: Infinite Scroll and Submitting a Form with AJAX
    /project_ajax_forms.md
    We'll play with using AJAX calls to an open API called the OMDB, creating a simple submission form and a movies display that never stops giving you movies when you scroll down.
